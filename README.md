# UsersApp
This app allows multiple users to manage their lists of persons. User can create new ones, delete existing ones and switch between them freely.
On people table is implemented simple validation (e.q. you cannot add person with wrong phone number or postal code).
Changes (like adding new person, changing or deleting) are saved only when "save" button is clicked. "Cancel" button will discard changes and
load original data from before changes was made.
Data in table is saving in file on user switch and when app is closing so you dont have to worry about your data.

Used technologies:
  - C# 
  - WPF
  
HINT:
  - To delete row you use "delete" button on your keyboard.
